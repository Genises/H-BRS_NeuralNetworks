    "Task:\n",
    "    - Train a recurrent neural network to output the lyrics of a song, given a starting word/character.\n",
    "    - Build two models: one based on characters (input and output are one-hot encoded characters), and another based on words with embeddings (inputs and outputs are embedding-encoding of words).\n",
    "    - Compare your results and (subjectively) evaluate which method generates \"better\" songs, or which model is easier to learn.\n",
    "    - There will be an internal competition about which generated text is funnier/weirder, based on a democratic vote. This will not affect your grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "    - The example below uses characters. You will have to make a model that uses words for generating text rather than characters.\n",
    "    - Read about python generators and the yield operator.\n",
    "    - Embedded words using a keras.layers.Embedding layer.\n",
    "    - Initialize the embedding layer with pre-trained weights as explained in the link below:\n",
    "        https://blog.keras.io/using-pre-trained-word-embeddings-in-a-keras-model.html\n",
    "    - The acquisition of data is left open but a common dataset can be found here:\n",
    "        https://www.kaggle.com/mousehead/songlyrics/\n",
    "    - Implement your model using keras.Sequence (or your own generator)\n",
    "    - Use model.fit_generator to fit model.\n",

    "Look at the example below (taken from the official Keras examples).\n",

    "The model based on words creates lyrics which consist of actual words and parts of sentences do make sense. The model based on characters uses special characters e.g. line breaks and punctuation which is nice but the text generated is worse. The actual text is the most improtant aspect for us, therefore we prefer the model based on words."
